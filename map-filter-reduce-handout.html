//~ * Map * ~

//TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values
// var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
// var evens = [];
// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
//     if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
//         evens.push(numbers[i]);
//     }
// }
// console.log(evens); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(function(num){
//     return num +1;
// })

// console.log(numbersAddOneMap);

const favoriteRestaurants = [
    {
        name: "Chik-Fil-A",
        address: "3102 Garden Rd, Burlington, NC",
        restaurantFeatures: ["buffet"]
    },
    {
        name: "C&Z Grill",
        address: "139 W. Elm Street ",
        restaurantFeatures: ["Take-out"]
    },
    {
        name: "Mayflowr Seafood Restarant",
        address: "1160 Huffman Mill Road",
        restaurantFeatures: ["buffet"]
    }
]
//TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

//TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!

let nameList = favoriteRestaurants.map(function(restaurant){
    return `${restaurant.name}  ${restaurant.address}`;
})
console.log(nameList);

//TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins

//TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins

//~ * Filter * ~

//TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)

// var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
// var evens = [];
// for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i += 1) {
//     if (numbers[i] % 2 === 0) {
//         evens.push(numbers[i]);
//     }
// }
// console.log(evens); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

//TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

// var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
//
// let evens = numbers.filter(function(num){
//     return num % 2 === 0;
// })
// console.log(evens);

//TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants

let hasBuffet = favoriteRestaurants.filter((restaurant)=>{ return restaurant.restaurantFeatures.includes('buffet');

})
console.log(hasBuffet);
//TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter than 8 characters" or get as complicated as you'd like!

//TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!
let hasMoreThanEight = favoriteRestaurants.filter(function(restaurant) {
    return restaurant.name.length >= 8;
})
console.log(hasMoreThanEight);
//~ * Reduce * ~

//Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:

//TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!

let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
let sum = numbers.reduce(function(total, num){
    return total + num;

},0)
console.log("our numbers added up are " + sum);

//TODO Together: Let's take a step a bit deeper with .reduce() - .reduce()'s output can take many forms and shapes. For example, let's say we wanted to have a little Javascript that would count the length of the strings in an array and return that info back to us in an object. For example: ["Codeup", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco Cohort", "ES6"] would get us {}
let stringArr = ["Codeup", "San", "Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco", "Cohort", "ES6"];
let strLengthObj = stringArr.reduce(function(objectProp, element){
    objectProp[element] = element.length;//assign the length as a value of the property named element{elementName:elementLength}
    return objectProp;
},{})
//keeps adding more information to the empty object from an object property.
console.log(strLengthObj);



//TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.

// function countWords(sentence) {
//     const words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words
//     const wordCountObject = words.reduce((wordCounts, word) => {
//         if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
//             // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
//             wordCounts[word] = 1;
//         } else {
//             // otherwise increment the existing count
//             wordCounts[word] += 1;
//         }
//         return wordCounts;
//     }, {}); // start with an empty object
//     return wordCountObject;
// }
//
// countWords('Mary had a little lamb , little lamb , little lamb');
// {Mary: 1, had: 1, a: 1, little: 3, lamb: 3}


//TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!

function countWords(sentence) {
    let words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words
     words = words.filter(function(word){
        return word !== ",";
    })

    let wordCountObject = words.reduce((wordCounts, word) => {
        if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
            // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
            wordCounts[word] = 1;
        } else {
            // otherwise increment the existing count
            wordCounts[word] += 1;
        }
        return wordCounts;
    }, {}); // start with an empty object
    return wordCountObject;
}

countWords('Mary had a little lamb , little lamb , little lamb');

let famMembers = [
    {
    name: "Nicole",
    age: 42,
},
{
    name: "Kim" ,
    age: 46
},
{
    name:"Yolanda",
    age: 47

    }
]

console.log(famMembers)


//TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).

let ageFam = famMembers.reduce(function(ageTotal,famMember){
    return ageTotal + famMember.age;
},0);
console.log(ageFam);
